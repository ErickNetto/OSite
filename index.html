        <h3>COGNIZE THE GREEN HERB</h3>
        <p>The Green Herb is used for Physical Strength and has appeared in every game in the series to date. Combining Green Herbs with Red Herbs, Blue Herbs, and Yellow Herbs can have significant health benefits, such as health being completely restored, poisons being cured, and maximum health being increased. Likewise, combining one (or two Green Herbs in some games) with another Green Herb will raise the herb's potency, thereby increasing its health restoration amount.        </p>
